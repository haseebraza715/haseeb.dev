🐰 A playful C program that brings spring to life by letting you manage a bunny poetry contest, where each fluffy contestant competes to become the Easter Bunny King. Users can register bunnies with their poems, track egg counts, and update or delete entries — all through a simple command-line interface with file-based storage on Linux systems.

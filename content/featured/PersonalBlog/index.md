ðŸŽ¯ A minimal, self-hosted blog platform built with Flask that supports article management, tag-based filtering, full-text search, and a lightweight admin interface for publishing content. The system uses file-based JSON storage, making it simple to deploy without a database. Deployed on Render with Gunicorn, the blog supports dynamic routing and static file serving.

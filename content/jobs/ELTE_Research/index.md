- Building a Python-based pipeline to estimate heart rate from 3-axis accelerometer data collected via a custom smart ring.
- Implementing autocorrelation and peak detection techniques to extract heart rate from BCG signals over short time windows.
- Integrating statistical signal quality filters (e.g., skewness, kurtosis) to improve accuracy by excluding motion-corrupted data segments.
- Working with Python and MATLAB to develop signal processing algorithms for biomedical data analysis.
- Collaborating with faculty members on research projects involving wearable technology and health monitoring systems.

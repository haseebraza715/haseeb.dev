- Built a Python-based pipeline to estimate heart rate from 3-axis accelerometer data collected via a custom smart ring.

- Implemented autocorrelation and peak detection techniques to extract heart rate from BCG signals over short time windows.

- Integrated statistical signal quality filters (e.g., skewness, kurtosis) to improve accuracy by excluding motion-corrupted data segments.

- Worked with Python to develop signal processing algorithms for biomedical data analysis.

- Collaborated with faculty members on research projects involving wearable technology and health monitoring systems.
